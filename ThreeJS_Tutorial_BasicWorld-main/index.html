    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>Hey, how's work been?</span>
    <div>I'm so glad you finally landed a job, now I don't have to take on the full rent anymore... I <strong>really</strong> hope you can hold this job down.</div>
    
    <h4>Jace:</h4>
    <span>It wasn't so bad, how about you?</span>
    <div>You're gonna be so disappointed in me. Please change the subject.</div>
    
    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>Oh, come on! <em>(playfully)</em> What's been going on?</span>
    <div>I haven't talked to you in so long about anything other than talking about finding you a job.
    I miss talking to you, I wanna see how the job went!</div>
    
    <h4>Jace:</h4>
    <span><em>(averting eyes)</em>Well, there wasn't really anything that unusual or anything...</span>
    <div>You're gonna be so disappointed in me. Please change the subject.</div>
    
    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>Well, enlighten me anyway.</span>
    <div>Come on.</div>
    
    <h4>Jace:</h4>
    <span><em>(awkwardly)</em>Well, I mean you know how it works. First days are always awkward. I spent like 3 hours on orientation videos.</span>
    <div>How do I tell you I quit anyway?</div>
    
    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>Well, how about the next five hours? I mean, you didn't just spend the rest of them on lunch or something, right?</span>
    <div>I have a bad feeling about this.</div>
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> A BEAT. </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <h4>Jace:</h4>
    <span><em>(resigned)</em> Okay.</span>
    <div>Here we go.</div>
    
    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>"Okay"? What does that mean?</span>
    <div>Oh no.</div>
    
    <h4>Jace:</h4>
    <span><em>(resigned)</em> Okay. So. I didn't get past the drug test.</span>
    
    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>What do you mean you didn't pass the drug test? I told you you shouldn't smoke for like a week. How hard could that be?</span>
    <div>Okay. Here we go again.</div>
    
    <h4>Jace:</h4>
    <span>What? I hung out a few days ago with the guys. It was the Saturday when Damian finally got back from the service. What was I supposed to do?</span>
    <div>I mean, come on.</div>
    
    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>Um, you could've just skipped a day and celebrate the week after when you got the job.</span>
    <div>Goddammit. I knew it. Excuses. Excuses. Excuses.</div>
    
    <h4>Jace:</h4>
    <span>It was a Saturday! Damien's finally back! I mean, how is that a crime?</span>
    <div>How am I supposed to relax when you're always nagging at me all the time? </div>
    
    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>It's not a crime to spend your time with the guys but you've been doing it for the past 3 months. You could at least wait until you actually landed a job to do something like this. You know how hard it is to find jobs nowadays that pay a decent amount.</span>
    <div>Yeah, jobs that don't require a GED. YOU CAN'T EVEN FINISH YOUR GED.</div>
    
    <h4>Jace:</h4>
    <span>Okay, well.<em>(monotone)</em> I'm sorry, okay? I don't even get why you're so concerned about this. It's not a big deal.</span>
    <div>God. I just wanna get outta here.</div>
    
    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span><em>(exasperated) </em>It's not a-- It <em>is</em> a <strong>big deal</strong> because I've been paying the rent for the past 3 months. </span>
    <div></div>
    
    <h4>Jace:</h4>
    <span>You told me it was fine! I had a little injury at work and because of it I couldn't work there anymore.</span>
    <div>So now you're complaining that I've been sitting on my ass all day the past 3 months. </div>
    
    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span> You could've at least filed for unemployment. I mean, that's basically free money while you were healing up.</span>
    <div>And you couldn't even do that.</div>
    
    <h4>Jace:</h4>
    <span>I mean, yeah I didn't think about it. I was just feeling too woozy from all the drugs. You know what? I think those drugs got into my system and that's what caused the failed test.</span>
    <div>I know she's gonna eat this up.</div>
    
    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span> You might be right.</span>
    <div>I need to break up with him.</div>
    
    <h4>Jace:</h4>
    <span>Yeah. And you know what? It's not a big deal. I'll really go for it next time.</span>
    <div>Nailed it.</div>

    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>Alright, I'm going back out, I gotta run some errands.</span>
    <div>This is it. I'll never get to him.</div>


    <br>
    <br>


    <h2> SCENE 2 : Alyssa's car </h2>
    <h4>Alyssa (on the phone):</h4>
    <span>Yeah, and I don't know what to do with him anymore, I think I'm about to break up with him.</span>

    <h4>Crystal (on the phone with Alyssa):</h4>
    <span>Girl, you need to get out of there. He's clearly a freeloader.</span>
    <div>This girl's been talking about this damn guy for <em>MONTHS</em>. I don't care for it...</div>

    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>I will. It's just...</span>
    <div>I don't know how to say this. I just feel so defeated.</div>

    <h4>Crystal:</h4>
    <span>Just what?</span>
    <div>Is she...</div>

    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>I just never expected to fall in love so fast and so hard. But I think maybe I was just infatuated. Maybe I should take a break from dating.</span>

    <h4>Crystal (sighs):</h4>
    <span>I'm here for you, girl. You'll find someone. He never understood how to treat a girl like you, and it's really on him for failing to realize your sacrifices. I mean, two jobs? You're nailing it girl.You deserve so much more. You don't need any man. </span>
    <div>Oh, I thought... nevermind...</div>

    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>(defeated sigh) Yeah.Sorry for ranting about this again. Thank you for listening to me, I know I've been talking to you about this for so long, you must be tired of it.</span>
    <div>I feel like a burden. But I'm so grateful for her. She's always been there for me, I love her so much.</div>

    <h4>Crystal:</h4>
    <span>No worries, I'm always gonna be here for you. You're the strongest person I know, and that should tell you a lot since we've been friends since childhood!</span>
    <div>You deserve so much more.You deserve someone who loves you for everything you do and never fails to appreciate you.</div>

    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>(laughs) Thank you, you've been there from the start, and I really appreciate you. But nevermind about me, how've you been? I hope you're not getting the same luck as me when it comes to dating.</span>
  
    <h4>Crystal:</h4>
    <span>(awkward laugh) Umm, hahaha. Funny you ask, cos I....</span>
    <div>I can't really tell her.</div>

    <h4>Alyssa (excited):</h4>
    <span>Is there any good news? Come on, tell me! I need a refresher from all this depressing BS with Jace.</span>
    <div>Spill the beans, girl! You never really tell me anything whenever I start dating someone. And you've never dated anyone since middle school.</div>

    <h4>Crystal:</h4>
    <span>I'm unlucky as hell... With girls and guys. I just can't find someone who I vibe with.</span>
    <div>I can't tell her I've been in love with her this whole time. </div>

    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>Babe, you'll find someone. I'm here for you, too.</span>

    <h4>Crystal:</h4>
    <span>Yeah. I'll be fine. I'd rather focus on myself and chill out for a bit you know? </span>
    <div>I can't tell her something so heavy when she's on the brink of a breakup. </div>

    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>Come to think of it, we should just take a little vacation together. Wanna go on a roadtrip?</span>
    <div>Let's take a break and reconnect. I missed you.</div>

    <h4>Crystal:</h4>
    <span>Oh?</span>
    <div>Oh shit seriously?</div>

    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>Yeah. I missed us spending time together.</span>

    <h4>Crystal:</h4>
    <span>I missed you too. I'd love to take a trip with you. </span>
    <div>Maybe I should tell her on the trip then...</div>

    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>Yeah. We both deserve a break. </span>
    <div>I'm excited.</div>

    <h4>Crystal:</h4>
    <span>Alright then, it's a date.</span>
    <div>Pfft this is a shot in a dark but I hope she takes it as a joke.</div>

    <h4>Alyssa:</h4>
    <span>Hehe, of course! Okay, I'll let you know when I'm available.</span>
    <div>A date it is.</div>
